# Assembly
Course from Oregon State University covering Microsoft Assembly Language. This course used the book and MASM library by [Kip Irvine](http://kipirvine.com/asm/). If you want to run these programs you must install the Irvine_7th_edition.msi file. A write up on how to use each program would take decades for me to write. Kip Irvine has a great set up guide [here](http://kipirvine.com/asm/gettingStartedVS2015/index.htm) - simply follow that and substitute in my program files to use them.

## Program 1
This program will display the programmer's name and the program's title to the user. The user will be instructed to input two positive itegers. Using these numbers, the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder will be displayed. A terminating line  will be displayed before the program ends.

## Program 2
Interacts with user to print a Fibonacci sequences to a user specified count. First the program will get the user's name and print it to the screen. Next the user tell the program how many Fibonacci numbers to calculate. User input will be validated. Finally, output Fibonacci terms using MASM loop instruction using iteration.

## Program 3
Get negatives numbers, in the range of [-100,-1], from the user until a non-negative is entered. The rounded average of all input negative numbers is displayed to the screen, as well as the count of integers entered, the sum, and a farewell message.

## Program 4
This program calculates a list of composite numbers. The amount of numbers printed is between 1 and a user specified count, n. The program will print up to 10 composites per line, until the nth term is reached.

## Program 5
This programs generates a set of random integers in the range of[100, 999]. The amount of numbers generated is determined by a user provided integer. The random numbers will be stored in an array. The unsorted integers will be printed, 10 per line. The arry will be sorted in descending order. After the sort, the median will be displayed, followed by the list of sorted integers, 10 per line.
